      <p class="card-text">
        This web application is a prototype developed for the early detection and monitoring of <strong>schizophrenia</strong> using artificial intelligence.
        It features a schizophrenia risk classification system powered by a <strong>logistic regression model</strong> trained on the publicly available <strong>COBRE dataset</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to assist clinicians in identifying potential early signs of schizophrenia through data-driven analysis.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        Key features include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Risk classification based on neuroimaging and symptom data</li>
        <li>Patient-friendly symptom logging interface</li>
        <li>Clinician dashboard with prediction outputs and reports</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="card-text">
        This is part of an academic research initiative aimed at integrating <strong>AI</strong> with <strong>digital mental health tools</strong> to improve accessibility and early intervention outcomes in psychiatric care.
