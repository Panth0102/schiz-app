Your COBRE dataset (from schizophrenia research) uses these columns:

SAPS stands for Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms
It is a standardized clinical scale in psychiatry
used to measure the severity of positive symptoms of schizophrenia
positive symptoms include things like hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior, disorganized speech
In your data:

saps7 → usually refers to the score on SAPS item 7 (for example, hallucinations or a specific positive symptom — the precise symptom depends on the study’s coding manual).
saps20 → similarly, item 20 of the SAPS scale
saps25 → item 25
saps34 → item 34
In many datasets, these numbers correspond to specific questions or subscales in the SAPS questionnaire:

for example:
SAPS item 7 might measure auditory hallucinations
SAPS item 20 might measure delusions of reference
SAPS item 25 might measure thought broadcasting
SAPS item 34 might measure bizarre behavior
However the exact definition of each item is given in the SAPS rating manual, which the COBRE study references in its methodology. If you want to look up exact symptom mapping, you’d refer to the COBRE documentation or the SAPS instrument itself.

✅ In summary

SAPS = positive symptom assessment
Each number = a different question/subscale
Higher scores = worse/more severe positive symptoms
That’s why they make good features for a schizophrenia classifier.
